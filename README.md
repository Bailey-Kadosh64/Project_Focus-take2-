Originally this was supposed to be a migrated verison of the original Project Focus repository that I created back in Feburary 2024.

Unfortunately, the project was missing multiple dependencies that I carelessly deleted and migrating to Godot 4 brought many new features and changes to my codebase that I did not know about.

This subsquent process has turned the project into an unorganized mess and as a result, I have decided to archive this repository and begin anew, starting from scratch, with a tutorial to teach me the basics.

Project Focus is not a tech demo to mindlessly give up on. Project Focus is a story and a journey that I plan on sharing with a community.

In other words that don't sound like a TED Talk, Project Focus is just beginning.

Thank you
